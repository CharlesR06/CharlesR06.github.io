## Favorite CPSC 120L labs 

Lab 2 part-1: 
This lab was fun because it felt like the first “real lab”. 
This lab was really enjoyable due to the simplicity that it was through. 
The cins and couts were the basic functions that are very key to doing code. 
It was used throughout every lab we did.

Lab 4 part-1
This lab was very interesting to me because we learned how to convert different measurements. 
We converted measurements such as milliliters to teaspoons, teaspoons, to tablespoons, etc.
We also learned how to declare and initialize double variables. 
This lab was very useful because we used it many times in various other labs also. 

Lab 11 part-2
This lab made me think in various different ways. 
I had to think outside the box due to the pushback function of pushback. 
We learned how to incorporate it into many of the different codes. 
This function allowed us to add another vector to the function.
